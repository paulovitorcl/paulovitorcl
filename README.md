# ðŸ‘‹ Hello, I'm PV

As a seasoned DevSecOps Engineer and Platform Specialist, I've spent years transforming how organizations build, deploy, and secure their cloud infrastructures. My experience spans multiple disciplines â€” from Site Reliability Engineering to Cloud Architecture â€” always with a focus on delivering solutions that don't compromise between speed, security, and reliability.

**Infrastructure Automation & Scalability:** I design and implement infrastructure-as-code solutions that enable teams to provision and manage resources consistently across environments, reducing deployment times by up to 80% while maintaining strict compliance standards.

**Security-First DevOps:** I integrate security practices directly into development workflows, establishing automated security scanning, vulnerability management, and compliance monitoring that catches issues early without slowing down delivery cycles.

**Cloud-Native Expertise:** Whether migrating legacy systems or building greenfield applications, I architect cloud solutions that leverage the full potential of modern platforms while optimizing for cost, performance, and maintainability.

**Observability & Incident Response:** I build comprehensive monitoring ecosystems that provide actionable insights into system health, enabling proactive issue resolution and reducing mean time to recovery by establishing clear alerting strategies and runbooks.

**AI Integration & Modern Workflows:** I help organizations incorporate AI-driven automation into their operations, from intelligent monitoring and alerting to automated remediation workflows that reduce manual intervention.
